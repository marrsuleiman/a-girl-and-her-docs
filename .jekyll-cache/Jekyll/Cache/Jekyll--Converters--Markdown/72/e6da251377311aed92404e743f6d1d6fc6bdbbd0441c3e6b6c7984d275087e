<p>A Graph is a mathematical term for an object that shows the connections between real-world entities. A graph consists of nodes(vertices) and edges. The edges in a graph exist to connect to nodes together. Social media networks like Twitter can be represented in a graph because it is possible to show that <strong>Mike</strong> <strong><em>Follows</em></strong> <strong>Ted</strong>. In this example, <strong>Mike</strong> and <strong>Ted</strong> will be represented as nodes in a Graph and the <strong><em>follows</em></strong> is the connection between them and is therefore the edge.</p>
