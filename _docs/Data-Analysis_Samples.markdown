# Introduction
During fundraising campaigns, we often do not have time to provide detailed analysis on which segments of our donor list to focus our time, money, and human resources to achieve our goal of raising the maximum amount of money. In the past, assumptions about the likelihood of higher response rates were based on our donors' age, sex, and postcodes. 

In the current financial state of the organisation, we have decided that we are more likely to maximise our net income by significantly reducing the budget of our communications via post since donors are increasingly donating via our website. The bulk of our expenditure goes towards fulfilment and postage. The assumption is that increased email communications lead to a higher response rate. 

This analysis contained in this report will test the assumptions that we have made about our donors and the most effective method of interacting with them. 

#### Data

The tables below show the total number of donors contacted in December 2017 and 2018 through Mail and Email.  The responses column shows the total number of responses for each communication method in each given year.  

| Year | Email | Responses   |
| :---        |    :----:   |          ---: |
| 2017      | 25,311       | 261   |
| 2018   | 5564       | 18     |




| Year      | Mail | Responses     |
| :---        |    :----:   |          ---: |
| 2017      | 69,762       | 3,382  |
| 2018   | 50,823        | 2,457      |


#### Methods

The data was collected using joins SQL  from our **Financial** tables and our **correspondences** tables from our Oracle database. From the **correspondences** tables, we collated the total number of emails and mail letters sent in December for 2017 and 2018. 

We calculated the total number of donors we contacted via post and email. Participants were informed of the organisation processing their data for analysis via our privacy policy. 

To calculate the response rates, we divided the responses by the number of donors the organisation contacted during the Christmas appeal for 2017 and 2018. In this report, when responses are referred to, we mean the number of donations made due to communication with a supporter. 

#### Results 

| Year      | Email Response Rate | Mail Response Rate     |
| :---        |    :----:   |          ---: |
| 2017      | 1.03%       | 4.85%   |
| 2018   | 0.32%       | 4.83%      |


In both 2017 and 2018, the response rate for Mail was 4.85% and 4.83%. Our Mail communications performed better than our Email communication method, which shows a response rate of 1.03% and 0.32% for 2017 and 2018, respectively.

Based on the results of the response rates, we cannot assume that email communications are leading to a rise in online donationsâ€”further exploration of our data is recommended to make an informed decision about cutting our Mail expenditure budget.
