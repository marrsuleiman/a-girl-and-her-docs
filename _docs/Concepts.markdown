# What is a Graph?


A Graph is a mathematical term for an object that shows the connections between real-world entities. A graph consists of nodes(vertices) and edges. The edges in a graph exist to connect to nodes together. Social media networks like Twitter can be represented in a graph because it is possible to show that **Mike** ***Follows*** **Ted**. In this example, **Mike** and **Ted** will be represented as nodes in a Graph and the ***follows*** is the connection between them and is therefore the edge.
